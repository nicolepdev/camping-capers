# ⛺ Camping Capers
### Camping game based on gameshow app project from the [Treehouse Front-End Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/)

## Project Overview:

In this project, I was challenged with creating a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

I created an array of phrases and wrote functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the letter the player has chosen is compared with a random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the the game board is updated with the chosen letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, one of the 5 guesses is removed.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a win screen is displayed. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, the game is over and a lose screen is displayed.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, it will be disabled.

## Tools/skills used:
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript

#### Guess the camping-related phrase before your fire burns out! I originally created this project for my front-end Techdegree, but I felt it needed more of my personal style.
